# This script will be executed after the execution of an export state in the Prism State Manager.
# You can use this file to define project specific actions, like manipulating the outputfiles.

# Example:
# print "Prism has exported objects."

# If the main function exists in this script, it will be called.
# The "args" argument is a dictionary with usefull information about Prism and the current export.

# def main(args):
# 	print args["prismCore"].projectName
# 	print args["scenefile"]
# 	print args["startFrame"]
# 	print args["endFrame"]
# 	print args["outputName"]
